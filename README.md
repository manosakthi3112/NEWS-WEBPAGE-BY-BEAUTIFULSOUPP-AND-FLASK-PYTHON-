# News Webpage Scraper 

This project is a simple web application built with Python, Flask, BeautifulSoup4, and Requests. It scrapes the latest news headlines and their corresponding images from the "Top Stories" and displays them on a clean, responsive webpage.

## Features

*   Fetches the latest news headlines from top stories.
*   Extracts associated images for each headline.
*   Displays the news in a simple card format.
*   Built with Flask for the web backend.
*   Uses BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing and web scraping.
*   Utilizes Requests for making HTTP requests.
*   Basic responsive design using Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Flask**
*   **BeautifulSoup4**
*   **Requests**
*   **HTML5**
*   **Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)**

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manosakthi3112/NEWS-WEBPAGE-BY-BEAUTIFULSOUPP-AND-FLASK-PYTHON-.git
    cd NEWS-WEBPAGE-BY-BEAUTIFULSOUPP-AND-FLASK-PYTHON-
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    *   On Windows, activate with: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   On macOS/Linux, activate with: `source venv/bin/activate`

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have completed the setup steps above and your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

## How it Works

The `app.py` script fetches the HTML content from `https://www.indiatoday.in/top-stories`, parses it using `BeautifulSoup4` to extract news headlines and image URLs, and then passes this data to an HTML template (`index.html`) which is rendered by Flask to display the news.

**Note:** The current scraping mechanism relies on specific CSS class names (`jsx-ace90f377543419c`) which might be auto-generated by the target website. These class names can change frequently, potentially causing the scraper to stop working. More robust scraping techniques (e.g., targeting structural elements or more stable class names/IDs) would improve the project's reliability.
